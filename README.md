- 👋 Hi, I’m @pro-digi-par

I'm the corporate repository of Pro Digi Par GmbH, an IT company in Hockenheim (former Formula 1 car race cityin southern Germany, near Mannheim, Heidelberg and SAP's headquarters in Walldorf). 

- 👀 I’m interested in ...

Pro Digi Par stands for Process Digitization Partners, so that's fundamentally what we care about. Right now, we are mostly working with three pieces of software: Odoo, Can-Do and Smart Commerce Solutions' SmartPlatform.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

... whatever's in front of my nose.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

well.. right now, nothing specific. "The boss" has sold his first software in the mid-80's, so there is experience from the soldering iron to AI available. If you have something that is both exotic and financially promising, I'd like to hear about it.

- 📫 How to reach me ...

For now: info@pro-digi-par.de

Needless to say, I'll update this README in the near future. Unless I get distracted.
